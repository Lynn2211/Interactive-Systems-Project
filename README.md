# Interactive-Systems-Project
Project for the lecture Interactive Systems at Saarland University

We use a WeMos micro controller to input morse code via a button or capacitive touch sensor and output it using a rotating servo or a 8 LED binary setup.
The code for the WeMos is written using the Arduino IDE.

We also included a Unity to WeMos communication and Unity 3D visualization of our project.
